# Jump Tutorial

I started my JAVA game programming adventure with a tutorial that I found on
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nv3MPgo9vI (in Polish)

It is a simple Doodle Jump or Icy Tower clone, made using <a href="https://libgdx.com/">libGDX</a>.

Compared to the code presented in the video, I added a dispose method for the used resources (I hope I did it correctly)
.

Later on I've created a new branch named <i>usingAssetManageer</i> based on
